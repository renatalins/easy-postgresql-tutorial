# SQL online querying processing tool
For create the schemas and querys displayed in this tutorial, I used the SQLFiddle (http://sqlfiddle.com). Basicaly the SQLFiddle creates the schemas and queries online, so you don't need to install the database on your computer. It's very easy to use and you have various database options to practice. With the SQLFiddle you can also sharing database problems and solutions because it creates a unique URLs for the database and queries as you use the site. For more information see http://sqlfiddle.com/about.html.
